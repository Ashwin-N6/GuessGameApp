# GuessGameApp
In this guessing game, the computer will come up with a random number between 0 and 999. The player must then continue to guess numbers until the player guesses the correct number. For every guess, the computer will either say “Guess Higher” or "Guess Lower", and then ask for another input. The player will be given 4 attempts to guess the number. Once all the attempts are finished the player has to start a new game. For each correct guess the player will get 5 points and can check the points in the Leader Board. Initially the player has to give his email id to start the game.
